In the program of fortran code, we can change the single particle energy/ pitch angle/ phase angle in the spacecraft rest frame (FAC coordinate), which is next adjusted into plasma rest frame.

Subroutines Bfield and Efield give the wave fields.

The plot_gyrophase.m code gives an example to load data and plot the gyro-phase distribution, which can also generate one file in the '.mat' format to save the data.
